## Support

Since I am extremely lazy I am not going to offer any support. Well maybe every once-n-a while. It really depends on my mood. 

That being said, time was spent documenting each command in the scripts. This should allow the scripts to be easily understood and modified if needed. 


## Donations
Many Bothans died getting this Monero (XMR) Miner to you, honor them by sending me some Crypto. ;)
